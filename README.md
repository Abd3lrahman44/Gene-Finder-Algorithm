# DNA GENE FINDER ALGORITHM

## This project was created by me as part of the online Duke University's course, Learn to program in java, on coursera.

### Part 1: Finding many Genes

This assignment is to write the code from the lesson to make the following improvements to your algorithm:

A. Find a gene in a strand of DNA where the stop codon could be any of the three stop codons “TAA”, “TAG”, or “TGA”.

B. Find all the genes (where the stop codon could be any of the three stop codons) in a strand of DNA.

### Part 2: HowMany - Finding Multiple Occurrences

This assignment will write a method to determine how many occurrences of a string appear in another string.

### Part 3: How Many Genes?

Write a program to count how many genes are in a strand of DNA.
